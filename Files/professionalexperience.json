    "description": "As a Python-based tool developer at LTTS, I designed and implemented tools that streamline engineering processes, significantly reducing time spent on manual analysis. Key projects include the 'Boundary Value Analysis' tool, which ensures thorough testing by generating reports for global variable values, and the 'Mapplot Tool,' which processes DLT files to provide insights on parameters like voice/data registration, RAT values, and geo-positioning. I collaborated directly with clients to gather requirements and incorporate them effectively into the tools.",
